I am excited to announce that I will be embarking on a JavaScript 100 projects, during which I will be working on various coding challenges, projects, and exercises to enhance my skills in JavaScript programming.

Throughout this project, I will be creating a repository for each day's work, which will include code files, documentation, and any necessary dependencies. In addition, I will be creating live demos to showcase the functionality of each project or exercise.

This project is a personal challenge for me to improve my coding abilities and explore new concepts in JavaScript. I am committed to completing the full 100 projects and am excited to share my progress with the community.

I invite you to follow my journey and provide feedback, suggestions, or support along the way. Thank you for joining me on this exciting adventure!
